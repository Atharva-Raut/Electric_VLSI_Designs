# CMOS Analog Design Self-learning Project
A collection of sample CMOS analog layouts in 0.6um technology, using Electric VLSI Design System<br>
This repository is a part of a self-learning project done to explore the field of CMOS Analog IC Design 
based on the concepts taught in the course EE618 (view on [CDEEP](https://www.cdeep.iitb.ac.in/vod/vodCloud/course_intra.php?ccode=296&referSrc=57dc9eb7be985a0e14aaa07846b0b9b4))<br>

___

[Amplifiers.jelib](Amplifiers.jelib) can be loaded in [Electric VLSI Design System](https://www.staticfreesoft.com/) to view the layouts

[C5_models.txt](C5_models.txt) contians the models for NMOS and PMOS transistors obtained from [here](http://cmosedu.com/jbaker/courses/ee421L/f13/students/mummm2/Lab4/lab4.htm)

[Amplifiers_design.docx](Amplifiers_design.docx) has calculations and approximations taken while designing the schematics
